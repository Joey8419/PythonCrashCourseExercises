# Python has a removesuffix() method that works exactly like the removeprefix().
# Assign the value 'python_notes.txt' to a variable called filename.
filename = 'python_notes.txt'
# Then use the removesuffix() method to display the filename without the file extension, like some file browsers do. 
print(filename.removesuffix('.txt'))
